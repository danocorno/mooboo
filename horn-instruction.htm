Years of experience in performance in various locations around the world have given me insight to be able to teach young beginners how to play the French Horn. My studios have been in West Ridge, Hill Country, and Dripping Springs public schools--all in or near Austin Texas.

I help budding Hornists with the fundamental aspects of playing the Horn, as well as teach them about music in general.  In each weekly meeting (lesson), we work on perfecting music for band quizzes, benchmarks, and band auditions; etudes to further technique; and music for Solo and Ensemble festivals.

Tuition per half-hour lesson is $25, paid monthly in advance.
