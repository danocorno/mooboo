		<p>What I Did.  .  .  

Infant and toddler years
Ten pounds and 2 ounces, the weight of my mother's penultimate child, made it her heaviest baby. I was born on 10 December 1968 at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing Michigan. I believe the time was 16:10. My first memory was of our family getting stuck in the green station wagon in the snow during a blizzard. The family car was left on the corner of Willow and Iroquois, just east of Grand Ledge, at the end of our home's street. My mother held me to her green faux-fur-lined coat and walked the remaining way home through knee-deep snow, shielding my face from the blowing bitter wind. I remember wanting to walk, but was told that I could not. I felt guilty that mom had to carry me, but soon felt contentment and security whilst held in her clutch. I'm told that I was 2 years old.  
Childhood
Who remembers their childhood?   Well, I'll just rattle off some incongruent memories. My little brother, Don, and I, and sometimes my friends, Brian Marshall, Craig Martzke, or Jeff Klingler, would ride our bikes down to the river and through the woods. There were plenty of trails that kids made, and plenty of adventures to be had. When I was in kindergarten, a classmate died and we planted a tree next to our school, Hayes Elementary. I was a safety monitor, wearing my orange sash, handing out tickets for running, etc.  . In grade 5, I played in recorder class, and sang in choir. The school plays had me in the roles of Bambi's dad, and Shier Khan, the tiger in The Jungle Book. My cousin lent some real deer antlers to me for my costume in Bambi. Grandma Andrus and her neighbour sowed them to my costume. My tiger costume was orange, with painted black stripes.  
Teenager
Band geek. Food fights in the cafeteria.Girlfriend. Shaving. Driving. First job.

My memories are a curious thing; their fragmentation and perhaps a lack of detail make them seem like my dreams. I don't know if that's a good analogy because I know that some people have extremely vivid dreams which seem almost real. At any rate, I'll do my best to encapsulate my life in early adulthood.  
Michigan State University was my destination. It was September 1987, and I had graduated High School 3 months earlier. I was very glad leave my High School days behind as I enjoyed the new-found freedom of college. I could tailor my classes to meet my needs and likes, and I could come and go as I pleased. There were plenty of interesting people to meet; friends were made, and my mind was expanded. That's the general description.  .  .  .now for some specifics.  
I was awarded a full-tuition scholarship to attend MSU to pursue Horn Performance. After a year or so, I auditioned for and won a spot in the Jackson Symphony, Jackson Michigan. A while later, I became an extra for the Kalamazoo and Lansing Symphonies. I also earned third Horn in the Battle Creek Symphony. These were part-time orchestras; playing in the evenings every now and then, but during the day I went to school.  
To earn money, I worked in the Student Union on campus. The manager of one of the kinko's in town came in to the union while I was working and asked me to come fill out an application for employment. I did, and was on my way to what would consume my post-college life.  
I decided that I would spend the next couple years playing in the various local orchestras in the evenings, while working at kinko's in the day. I would keep watch for Horn openings and audition for them. That's not what happened.  
I purchased a little red "motor bike", as Grandma Andrus called it.  That was shortly after I started college.  I knew that I needed my own wheels, and I saw all of those other students tooling around campus on them, so I found a motorcycle dealer who sold them.  I went down there with my dad to check them out.  We found a used one with 400 miles on it (that's probably like 4000 miles on a car).  My dad talked him down to $300 for the Honda Spree moped.  Finally... I had my own wheels!   Of course, my mother insisted that I buy a helmet.  My high-school buddy, Brad, took me to a farmer-type store in the boon-docks.  We found a red helmet to protect my head.  I could only drive it for only a few months a year because of the cold.  Even when it was relatively mild, the 30-mile-per-hour wind brought the wind-chill into factor.  I got the machine humming as efficiently as possible: I made sure that it had new spark plugs, its filters were clean, and that I used only the top grade gasoline--in fact, I added octane booster so that at times, I got close to 100 miles per gallon of gasoline out of it.  The poor thing only held 6/10 of a gallon, so I had to refuel on every trip from the house to school, which was about 30 miles each way.  My dad used to be the manager of the Meijer gas station on Saginaw St.  .  I used to stop there every day to fill up my tank for about 30 to 50¢.  One summer, I took it to Blue Lake fine arts camp, where I was a counselor.  I rode it around the camp, while others had their cars.  The camp was 10 miles from nowhere, so occasionally, I'd drive into "town" to fill up my portable gas can with fuel.  At one point, 3 of the other counselors decided that they didn't want to walk and piled on the little guy.  He tried desperately to carry them.  I don't know if it was old age or that incident, but that was the beginning of his decline.  He used to reach top speeds of 34 to 35 mph, but he could only muster about 27 after that.  
When I went to Blue Lake to be a counselor, that was just after my first year in college.  The summer before that, I went as a camper to Interlochen National Music Camp (although today, it's called Interlochen Arts camp or something).  I had attended the Interlochen music camp a couple times before, but they were for 2-week sessions each different summer.  Those were for middle-, and high-school groups composed of kids from Michigan only (nicknamed "State", however, this time, I went the "Nationals" 8-week session, composed of kids from around the globe.  I was a very lucky boy; I received a full-scholarship to attend the camp, due to the major influence of Ellen Campbell.  She was my horn teacher for the summer while at "State" the summer before.  She is the wife of Doug Campbell who would be my Horn Professor at Michigan State University.  She was my teacher at camp the summer before, but this summer Doug Campbell happened to be teaching at Interlochen.  Remember, he was to be my College Profs.  ...small world!   Anyway, during my 8-week escape from my parents, we played orchestral works of the masters, standard repertoire, etc.  , we had world-famous conductors lead the orchestra, I met a lot of cool people--peers of mine, and generally had a blast!   Of all of my first eighteen years of life on Earth, I think that that was my most profound summer.  I was on top of the world.  .  .or at least the World Youth Symphony Orchestra.  As a result of my audition upon arrival at the camp, I was placed as principal horn.  
In 1989, after my second year in college, I won an audition for the All American College Orchestra.   The group is assembled each summer to perform in the All-American College Orchestra in the American Gardens Theatre at EPCOT Center in Walt Disney World.   I guess that I became infatuated with Orlando, or maybe it was destiny, but I ended up moving to Orlando in October 1992, just after I graduated college.  They said that about 300 hornists auditioned and I was one of only four who got the gig.  It was the most thrilling thing yet to happen to me!  
I don't know if it was simply not being in Lansing, Michigan, or if it was truly Orlando which became a lure to me.  Maybe it wasn't even Orlando, but Disney.  It probably was Disney, because I didn't even go into Orlando much.  I lived in Kissimmee, south of Orlando.  My transportation was provided by Company-owned vans which toted us to and from the park.  In our "off" time, other kids from the orchestra would cart me around.  Our schedule was that of a musician: sleep till noon, play in the evening & night.  All cast members were allowed free entrance to any of the Disney theme parks, so we would frequently spend our days off there.  We would rehearse on a sound stage at the Disney/MGM Studios when there was a special guest with whom we were performing.  Some of the guest were: Rosemary Clooney, Bob McGrath (Sesame Street), Toni Tennille, Miss America 1989, and Roger Williams--famous for his version of "Autumn Leaves".  One weekend, a bunch of us went to Clearwater beach on the Gulf of Mexico.  Another morning, a van-load of us got up at 5am to drive to Cape Canaveral to see (and feel) a space-shuttle launch.  We also went to a concert put on by the London Symphony Orchestra.  Every other summer, they make Daytona Beach their home.  
About a week or so before our summer gig was to expire, I met another boy my age in the break room behind the American Adventure.  He was wearing a University of Michigan shirt, so I sat down and said that I went to Michigan State.  His name was Chad Whitehouse.  He attended Eastern Michigan, but was a U of M wannabe.  
During my last few years of college, I lived out in East Lansing in an apartment just north of campus.  I either rode my bike, walked, or rode my moped to where I needed to go.  Sometimes, I'd ride my moped over to my grandma's house.  She'd fix dinner or something for me.  She was like my second mom.  When I was growing up, she would come to stay from monday until tuesday to baby-sit.  I would go stay over at her house often, just like a little holiday.  There were many memories made with her, but that's for another story.  I loved her very much.  
I had decided not to attend the ceremony.  I think that they're silly.  You want to get married?   Fine, sign the forms; poof, you're married.  You graduate from school.  .  .just get your piece of paper and be on your way.  Why go through all that unnecessary hassle?
There I was, my last day of college.  .  .graduating.  I was getting thrown out into the "real" world!   I had already attended several graduations throughout college by being a member of a music group.  I was always a member of the university's main orchestra, but there were a couple semesters when I foolishly enrolled in band (yuck!).  Anyway, the point is that I had my fill of graduations.  Why should I attend my own?
A couple weeks past since my last class when I opened my mail to find my diploma.  I threw it in my "keep-sake" box.  
A month earlier, in May, I bought my first 4-wheel transport.  It was a white Suzuki Samurai.  An acquaintance sold it to me.  He and his partner were moving to San Francisco where he would no longer need his own vehicle.  It was kind of warm (for Michigan) this June day, so I packed a little bag and headed for the beach.  There is this little artsy town on Lake Michigan, south of Holland, called Saugatuck.  I traveled the almost two-hour trip with the top down.  I loved that little truck.  I was almost like driving a toy car; it was small, yet sturdy.  It was fun to drive, or even just sit in.  The canvas top could just roll up in to a ball and be tucked away.  It was nice to have such independence.  I just woke up, looked outside, and decided to go for a drive to the lake.  I got there and walked a bit down the beach, and then found a nice spot up on the dune.  The dunes on Lake Michigan are about 2 stories high, so I had a nice view all around.  It was great; not too cold, not too hot.  .  .nice breeze, puffy clouds...what fun!
I had been working at kinko's as a part-time cashier for a year, and now that I had no school to attend, I asked to go full time.  Within weeks, I was promoted to supervisor.  My good friend Michael Persons, also worked there as an assistant manager.  He helped bring me out of my social shell.  We would occasionally go to a café or night club--more often cafés; we weren't really into clubs.  He was my best friend.  It had been two years since we met, when in August, just after my graduation, he moved to Vermont.  I think that he wanted to be closer to the love of his life who lived in Montréal, Québec.  I guess that that fizzled, so he moved to Seattle, Washington.  He worked for kinko's as a manger of Computer Services.  
I would sometimes ride my little moped several miles to Michael's 70-year-old studio apartment.  I remember one cold winter night, we drank cappuccino in little ceramic cups, while sitting on the floor next to the old radiator.  We listened to some early 20th-century Jazz-singer named Bessy or something like that.  I can't say if it was extraordinary for Michael, but it made an impression on my memory, being exposed to new and exciting things..  
What was the purpose of college?   Is it to get a degree?   Is it to gain knowledge?   Is it to get a "better" job?   Is it the experience?   My uncle said that college is for the experience--the social interaction; stuff to use your whole life, whether you know that you learned it or not.  I agree.  Many people say that you need college to get a "better" job.  That may be true, but I think that they are thinking that you need a degree in a particular field to get a high-paying job; to them, the main thing is money.  Perhaps my view of college is a bit of a rationalization about my own situation.  I went to school to become a professional horn-player.  I left school a changed person.  I wasn't as introverted, timid, and shy as when I went in.  Yes, I'm still those things today, but not as severe.  I felt like a bit of a failure because I was not using music to make money.  My parents spent their money on lessons for me as a kid,  I spent time and money as a college student.  Everyone expected me to "make it big" someday.  If this weren't a capitalistic society, I would have been in an orchestra, or other ensemble.  But, I needed income, and music is not a sure way of getting it.  Maybe I was too practical.
As my college days were waning, I took three auditions.  The first was to become a Masters student at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  It's very selective; they only take 1 hornist a year in to the school.  Of course I was not the one.  I auditioned for the Columbus (Ohio) Symphony Orchestra, 2nd horn, and failed.  They didn't even let me finish the first round; "NEXT!", they said.  My only audition which was remotely successful was is Windsor, Ontario.  I made it all of the way to the finals.  My college teacher, Janine Gaboury-Sly told be that the principal hornist liked my sound, but the others on the committee wanted that tubby American sound!   Even though it was a "behind the screen" audition, I guess that he knew somehow who was playing.  So, I decided to work at kinko's full time, and do the occasional freelance gig.  Being infatuated with Florida, drawn to it like a magnet, I looked in the kinko's employment paper for a job in Orlando.  I sent my résumé, interviewed on the phone, and got the job.  
I departed East Lansing on 2 October 1992.  I stopped at the chemistry building, where my mom worked, to say goodbye to my parents.  Just before I got in the car, I gave my dad my ice scrapper from the car.  My mom cried.  
mike*******************************************************************************************
A few years later, after blowing dust off of my Horn case (literally), I auditioned for the North Carolina Symphony, but I was not accepted. Then, a while later, I finally had success at an audition!   The Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music offered a full-tuition scholarship to me. Circumstances at the time did not allow me to pack-up and leave for Ohio, so I just settled for the "warm fuzzy" of feeling wanted by that school.  
My mother, or should I say "Stage Mother", coaxed me into finding local gigs in Orlando. I eventually went to play with the community band. Although it is a free gig, the members consist of free-lancers from the area who treat the ensemble as a sort of social arena; you know.  .  .to see and be seen.  .  .getting to know the right people.  .  .that sort of thing.  
Well, on my first night there, a contractor asked me to play in the Mantovani Orchestra on their Christmas tour. I did. A few months later, I got a call to play on tour with Frank Sinatra Jr.  . I did. It was dry until September 1999 when Mantovani called me again. I think that it's because my area code changed and the contractors couldn't get a hold of me--I hope. Anyway, I went on the Christmas tour again--this time it took us all over the Eastern half of the USA. It took four weeks, riding on a bus, city to city.  
kinko's was my "day job". I enjoyed the job which I had sculpted. For the most part, I spent kinko's money; I purchased supplies and managed the payroll.  It was a steady and reliable occupation.
