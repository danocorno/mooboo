<a href="http://www.musicabella.com/history/biographies/page_Degnan_Jann.htm">Jann</a> calls me Dann.   <a href="http://verbosevada.com/">Mom</a> calls me Danny.   Oh yeah, and she spells my last name with an apostrophe: O'Donnell.   The United States Social Security office spells my surname, "ODONNELL". Anyway you want to say it or spell it is fine, but I go by Dann ODonnell.

A factor in my life was the musical influence of my <a href="https://mooboonet.wordpress.com/family/">family</a>.  Everyone played an instrument, and my mother taught me to play the piano and organ.  I took up the <a href="http://www.hornsociety.org/">Horn</a> in grade 6, and have been playing since then.  Some of my musical markers are recorded on my <a href="https://mooboonet.wordpress.com/horn-performance/">Horn</a> page.  I play the (french) Horn now, professionally freelancing, generally in the region of San Diego California, U.S.A..

Gardening is my hobby, I suppose. I like to grow and care for the ever-expanding inventory of edible plants, trees, and flowers.  <a href="http://www.naturalgardeneraustin.com/">Natural Gardener</a> is one of my favourite garden stores to visit.
